#### Image Transforms:
**Fourier Transform** - Converts the signals from time domain to Frequency domain. 
**Inverse Fourier Transform** - Converts the signals from Frequency domain to time domain.
Discrete Fourier Transform: Image processing tool used to decompose an Image into its sine and cosine components. 

#### Key takeaways:

1. From the gratings and the FT visualization, the distance of the dots from the centre represents the frequency of the grating
2. Orientation of the dots represent the orientation of the grating
3. Value of the pixels making up the dots in the FT represents the amplitude of the grating
